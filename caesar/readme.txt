This is the super basic caesar cipher.
It results in moving the alphabet up or down an n number of letters.
One example being a caesar shift of 5 up would change a to f.
This also means that there is wrapping that occurs.

This will be compiled using gcc in a unix environment.

Program can be run in two ways:

print to screen:
-------------------
program # inputfile
-------------------
program - the name you compiled your program to
# - the amount you want to shift up or down  
inputfile - the name of the input file you want to shift

print to file:
------------------------------
program # inputfile outputfile
------------------------------
program - the name you compiled your program to
# - the amount you want to shift up or down  
inputfile - the name of the input file you want to shift
outputfile - the name of the file you want to output to
